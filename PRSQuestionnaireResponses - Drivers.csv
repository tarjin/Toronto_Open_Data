What do you think is driving poverty in Toronto? What do you think are the effects of poverty?
"     As a child in another city my parents had difficulty meeting basic needs for our family. We were constantly in debt: often coal was purcahsed by the small bagful  and it was often cold in the house in winter. Because of lack of funds, neither the chimney nor the electrical wiring was maintained properly/updated and this resulted in two fires. My siblings and I hardly ever had any new clothing to wear.  Although our parents encouraged us  in our education,we always felt marginalized because we could not afford fees for after school activities.      The effects of poverty can be experienced across the life cycle of the individual and family. They are  hunger, inadequate housing,frustration, low self esteeem, ill health, inability to keep up with peers in the school system, students' decreased ability to participate in extra curricular activities,school dropouts resulting in the following: low level of job market competitiveness, dysfunctional coping behaviours,including drug/alcohol addiction,,participation in crime including family violence,There is evidence that having lived a life of poverty shortens the person's average lifespan."
" * fewer full time jobs with benefits * shortage of affordable housing * rising cost of essentials (food, housing, clothing)  * social assistance benefits that do not cover basics * lack of affordable day care spaces * bottle necks in public transit, especially in marginally serviced areas"
" -lack of affordable housing exacerbates poverty -OW and ODSP rates are not high enough to live on in Toronto -poverty causes and can exacerbate mental illness -there are not enough opportunities for education  As a family physician with Inner City Health Associates, I witness the effects of poverty every day.  Poverty makes my patients sick.  Poverty shortens life spans, increases rates of depression and addiction, and exacerbates heart disease, diabetes, lung disease, and other illnesses.  My patients' health would improve if they had better access to affordable housing, transportation, food, and education and employment supports."
 -low social assistance rates -high cost of housing and rental units -Ontario government took away rent control -values that blame people on low income instead of looking at systemic reasons -minimum wage is too low -change in politics and economics since the 1980's that is leading to growing gap between the rich and poor in Canada and across the globe -lack of political will  what are the effects of poverty -stress that affects health and choices -can't afford medications and healthy foods -feeling alienated from power structures and decision makers -marginalized groups of people being pitted against each other for less resources -youth unemployment and poverty is one factor that can drive youth to engage in dangerous or illegal activities -being left out -

" -My husband grew up poor -- we spent many years paying off his debts and supporting his Mom - I worked as a teacher and a principal  for 35 years in schools-- all the schools were in areas where  the majority of the students were poor - I worked at CAMH for 7 years and saw directly the connections between mental illness and poverty - Currently I do extensive volunteer work with the Elizabeth Fry halfway house, the Seeds of Hope Foundation, and Stitching Our Social Safety Net so I am regularly with people who have firsthand knowledge of poverty and who live with its effects."
"1. High rents and Not enough jobs that pay well  This means that people are trapped in their jobs. So if the working conditions are toxic they have no choice. Their health deteriorates and then they can no longer work and they will apply for ODSP. Except that they won't get ODSP ...not the first time.  Everyone knows that.   2. Classism and sexism  I once called the police for support when I worked at a bar in parkdale, they refused to come and told me that women shouldn't be working bars alone.  Wow. Then, at 2am I took the streetcar home and passed the Drake and The Gladstone and there are police milling about...protecting the valuable people. You know who helped me? The two guys dealing drugs outside the bar.  No joke.    "

Affordable Housing!!! Youth dropping out of school- not enough programs for youth with mental health-leads to poor employment opportunities- despair-drugs/alcohol- Lack programs that support adult education-  
Affordable housing.  The prices of homes and apartments is unreal.  Lower social assistance rates.  Loss of good paying jobs.  The disparity between the rich and the poor is growing.  Just plain greed.
"As a person working with people living in poverty, I see several priorities that the city along with other levels of government need to work on: 1- affordable and supportive housing 2- increase social assistance rates to reflect the cost of living 3- increase minimum wage to reflect the cost of living, 14-15$ per hour. 4- Affordable subsidized daycare ( that includes a national daycare plan) 5- Affordable public transportation and that should include looking into free public transportation."

"causes: 1. Toronto is touted as a 'diverse' and immigrant friendly city but when we welcome newcomers into Toronto we do not give them the support they need to thrive, leading to a cycle of poverty 2. Stigma against and lack of support for people with mental health issues.  3. TCHC rut, 10 year waiting list, those people in housing are trying to get out but can't because OW/ODSP is so small, and those on the list trying to get in  Effects: 1. An inefficient city! When those people living in poverty are not doing what they are skilled at or passionate about we lose talent that could go a long way in moving our city from great to amazing. 2. Higher income folks earning more and keeping it, without feeding it through the city, and lower income folks getting less and less resources."
"Causes: Lack of affordable, accessible child care. Affordable housing deficit. Increasing cost of transit (without income-based subsidies). Meagre social assistance rates. lack of mental health supports.  Effects: Alienation and isolation. Poor educational outcomes for children in low-income households.

"Corporations not willing to train people or pay people that are just out of school hiring them as interns etc,  Businesses that do not hire full time employees.

"Driving poverty is high cost of living in Toronto and limited access to public housing. Little access to affordable childcare makes it very difficult for parents to work, particularly at minimum wage, and afford safe, regulated childcare.  People are forced to live on the periphery and there remain TTC challenges in getting to work in the core.  The effects of poverty are hungry children unable to concentrate at school, and high stress and illness for parents."
"Driving poverty- racism, discrimination, unaffordable housing, lack of good jobs with benefits, wages that are inadequate, lack of political clout for poor people, lack of access to education/training programs. low (and cruel) social assistance rates, Effects of poverty - loss of talent and skills as poor people cannot be focused on contributing to society,"

"Generational - It's generational and children born into poverty don't seem to escape it - if their parents are in receipt of Ontario Works (OW) - the children tend to when they reach 18 and can apply on their own also it seems that they have a higher rate of children with teenage pregnancy and then they receive OW.  Education - parents don't have grade 12 and children tend to not graduate.  Life Skills - basic things as attending an appointment with the OW worker - about 50% of our youth do NOT attend scheduled appointments,  OW Legislation - (1) client are expected to job search but legislation is strict on when funds can be issued for transportation- should be issued to all - we should have an agreement with TTC and instead of giving funds a TTC pass issued. (2) Special Diet funds the legislation is again negligant in how it is issued - people who can go to their doctor and claim they have food allergies without any testing are issued extra funds - people who do not take advantage of the piece of legislation are under issued - this can be a massive difference in how much money a person is issued monthly - the difference for a single person can be as much as $250 and if you are a family of 5 you have an extra $1250 more than a person who doesn't...  Addictions & Mental Health - unable to participate in programs to help move them closer to finding employment or training. years ago we had a piece of legislation that allowed us to refer clients to FBA now ODSP as being ""sociall employable""  these were people who had sever addictions and had been struggling for years...  Self-esteem, motivation - not sure what it is but it is difficult to help people who don't seem to want the help - could be underying factors as to why - I know this is not a popular belief - but when you have worked in the field for 24 years this does happen  "

Housing costs and daycare costs and food costs. The riding income gap. And poor transportation. Everyone should have a home. It creates a sense of dignity. Pour nutrition and education do t help either and jobs thst are not fairly paid.   Effects are a weaker economy. A weaker middle kvass and less buying power to stimulate the economy. Violence and depression and health problems are other effects which tax the system.
"Housing costs and general costs of living (e.g. food costs). The only affordable housing is less than desirable and services are not as available as they should be.  Poverty causes unstable homes for children, stress, mental illness, and general illness. It is one of the main determinants of health."
"housing costs, lack of affordable housing, decent living wages, insufficient social assistance rates"
"I am a front line social worker and I work directly with people who live in poverty. In my opinion, there are multiple factors driving poverty, and they all have to do with people not having enough money to survive. Inadequate social assistance rates, low minimum wage, precarious and part-time employment, inadequate and inaccessible childcare, employment discrimination for people with disabilities and mental health challenges, lack of affordable housing"
"I believe that an unfair taxation system, coupled with systemic racism, is the driving force behind poverty in Toronto. The effects can be devastating, resulting in poor health, poor nutrition, learned helplessness, psychological problems, and ultimately crime."
i believe the driving force in poverty is that there isnt enough programs to help the people below the poverty line whom are canadian born to get out of poverty. i also believe if we put a 10 year pause on all immigration (meaning that the people who are here would recieve help but those that are applying to come and not in canada wouldn't) to allow for the government to put forth a system that would reduce the current poverty and homelessness.
I do volunteer work around poverty but have never experienced it myself. I feel seeing people sleeping on the streets/panhandling etc diminishes me as a person and makes our city seem mean.
I don't think this is a Toronto problem alone. It is the result of an economy that keeps widening the gap between rich and poor. However there could be local improvements to mitigate the worst fallout. See the points on the previous page.
I have participated in a Breakfast Lunch program at the Church of the Redeemer (Avenue and Bloor).  The people that make use of the program are either street people or under housed people attempting to make do on Social Services benefits.
"I have worked in the Shelter system for 20 years in Toronto with young people and the phrase that breaks my heart is ""I can't grow taller than the ceiling of my house."" Lack of hope amongst low income and impoverished young people leads to lack of motivation or belief that they can get out of the cycle of doing whatever they can just to survive. Poverty in this wealthy city is a result of lack of access to opportunity and lack of support in creating a positive future for individuals and families. People need more than just $$, they need role models and cheerleaders. Stigmas (all of them) play a big part in crushing hope and willingness to dream. Without dreams, you can't set goals."
I saw many of my students from poor homes unable to study because their background was limited.  Educational deficiencies due to poverty are not easily repairable in the classroom.
"I think education and labour are driving poverty in Toronto. Lack of proper education, mentor programs  and lack of jobs lead to a lot of teens below poverty level.  Biggest effects of poverty: mental health, homelessness, poor nutrition, no health and dental care, early death"
I think poverty in Toronto is because there is not enough funding in the city for other people. Not enough schools and to much laws on people with no status.
"I think poverty in Toronto is driven by income inequality, precarious/unstable/temporary jobs, lack of access to child care and other social or community services. Poverty is terrible, it significantly affects people's mental and physical health. Poverty carries a lot of social stigma and people are often blamed for their actions, which is often uncalled for, but carries a lot of emotional and material ramifications. "
"I think poverty is being driven in part by misplacement of funding by the government. More investment is needed at the community levels to help build complete, sustainable and resilient communities. Not enough engagement with residents to get to the bottom of the real issues affecting them. Not every community is the same or has the same challenges. Additionally, poverty is also being perpetuated by the inflated sense of social status within society. This city is wasting too much and consuming too much- unnecessarily. It's not heading in a sustainable path.   The effects of poverty on individuals are extensive, ranging across physical, social, psychological, mental and spiritual illness. There's inequality in access to GOOD (Skilled) jobs, affordable healthcare, housing, healthy food, and proper education. Crime is strongly correlated to poverty as well."
"I think poverty is driven by the lack of steady employment to members of our society especially young people, new immigrants, and people with previous charges"
"I think that some people become trapped by poverty because they are prevented from seeking opportunities. Single parents, immigrants, and other groups often can not leave home and there are insufficient social services in low income neighborhoods. Racial and other discrimination is of course another factor."
I think that the two main factors are: the price of housing (unavailability of affordable housing) and the low rates of OW payments.
I think the fact that you have to be either rich or poor in order to receive support from government.  People who are doing ok but still need a little help find it economically advantageous to just not work and receive benefits.  
"I think the seemingly intractable issue of poverty has a lot to do with the precarious job situation created in the 80's as the corporal down sizing started in earnest.  A lot of people are on contracts that have eliminated benefits and go to the lower bidders.  This sense of insecurity just helps drive down wages and begins the assault on unionized jobs.  People need to hold on more than on jobs to keep up their standard of living and that increases the competition of existing jobs. The people at the lowest rung of the employment ladder would be the first to be push off and harder to get back up.  For someone that have to travel to multiple low paying jobs, transportation is a big issue.  Without a good paying job, housing is a big issue. With precarious jobs people are vulnerable to slip into welfare and welfare reform is a big issue. It is hard for everyone, especially for racial minority, single parents (predominately women) or immigrants as they have less of a social network that can provide a semblance of safety net. So if corporate greed is not reined in there is only some feel good programs by some charity organizations to provide band aid service that cannot break the cycle of poverty.  We need a rethink of ourselves as citizens and ask ourselves what kind of society do we want and pressure various levels of government to start reforming the tax system, the welfare system and investing in cities where the impact on people's lives is most direct. We need to emphasize both individual responsibility and social responsibility toward each other so that we can truly live in a progressive world where everyone has a chance to succeed. "
I think what drives poverty in Toronto is the same thing that drives poverty everywhere and that is the intentional exploitation of huge masses of people.
"I was born in Alberta. I wish I had left it when I was twenty. I did leave it when I was forty. Life started then. In most parts of Canada, you do not have the  hate and scapegoating mentality you do  there. But Alberta poisons politics all across the country.  Lots of ignorant hateful fanatics everywhere.  Needs to be constitutional protection from hate speech and discrimination based on means of income. "
"I work in the social service sector, many of the families that I work experience the impact of poverty daily. The cost of living, the fact that the majority of jobs are now part time and have no benefits, the ridiculous cost of day care in the city makes it almost impossible for people to work are driving poverty.  The effects are what you see in the city right now... the great divide between people with no indicator that anything is going to change."
"I worked with women who could not afford to continue a pregnancy, with women who could not leave an abusive partner because they could not afford to, with women who could not afford methods of birth control that were not on the registry like copper IUDs.  Greed drives poverty.  Our taxation system is not equitable.  The 1% increasingly controls wealth eliminating the middle class and pushing more people down into poverty.  People who are poor are forced to make decisions others do not.  They are less healthy (see TPH reports) in every way.  The stress of poverty drives people into increasing depression affecting every aspect of their lives."
"If you give people the tools, there would not be any poverty. Educate the people to be independent and the government should make it a mandate for respect to be taught both home and in schools. Life would be much easier and they would play a better role in society. "
"In general, poverty is a result of the ""me"" ethic prevalent in society. Its not new, but seems more aggressive in the last 40 years. This ethic says things like, ""I'm OK and made it myself, so everyone else should be able to do likewise."" Combining this ethic with politician-inspired desire to reduce taxes (and therefore the size of government) has forced many out of a caring system into the trap of the revolving door of poverty: a trap which the non-poor fail to understand. In Toronto, the problem is more acute because the big city is a magnet for folks hoping to find jobs or better lives.  Poverty is draining for those caught in it - there is a constant struggle to try to get over the hurdles society puts in the way of those trying to get out of poverty. This struggle robs society of the human energy to do productive things for individuals and the society as a whole.   Poverty also puts a face on the City that makes me uncomfortable living here. Though It might be much worse elsewhere, I believe we should do better in Toronto and want to live in an environment that does not show a lack of caring for all."
Inaccessible affordable housing. In sufficient transit integration. Employment market over saturated with aging workforce.
"Inadequate financial support for individuals and families, receiving benefits.  High cost of public transit and limited/hindered access to TTC fare.  Limited access to subsidized housing."
"inadequate incomes, poor employment standards, lack of affordable housing."
"Income inequality, driven by years of stagnant wage growth in which wage increases do not match overall inflation.  Combined with rising prices for staples like housing and fuel, more and more workers are falling further behind and falling into poverty.  Inadequate social assistance and ODSP rates, combined with an inadequate minimum wage for the costs of living in Toronto, have exacerbated the problem. Meanwhile, the wealthy portions of our city have gotten even wealthier and there has never been a serious conversation about changing our municipal tax system to be progressive, geared to income and earnings.  If taxes were progressively increased on those who could afford to have their taxes increased, while those on fixed incomes weren't being targeted by regressive property tax increases, we'd have the money needed to fund social programs that prevent poverty. The ultimate impact of poverty is increased costs for everything from health care to policing.  If we invested in the programs and assistance that shrink income inequality now, we would save ourselves a lot of expenditures in the future."
"Income inequality; lack of mixed-income neighborhoods; lack of a federal proverty reduction strategy; lack of provincial and federal money.Causes crime, mental health issues, physical health issues, unhappiness, etc. "
"Increasing costs for housing, transportation, communications, food, etc. simply too high and out-of-balance with incomes and income growth Insufficient incomes.  Too many people paid at minimum wage which is a pathetic amount. Insufficient jobs and employment opportunities.  Not enough jobs that pay well over minimum wage. I also blame Colleges and Universities who are having students pay for tuition in fields these schools know have no jobs available when they graduate. Just like their is a need for a much larger Housing Strategy, there is also a need for a larger Employment Strategy completely aligned with Education based on actual employment supply-demand knowledge like Switzerland and Germany. Two countries in particular that represent extraordinary examples of success. This is a real scam that hurts everyone with best intentions of getting a sound education and winds up empty when they finally graduate and worse in deep debts. Canada should be ashamed of this. Insufficient benefit packages for people in low income jobs.. "

We need:  1) more subsidized housing;  2) more shelters for victims of violence;  3) higher income supplements for families with children; 4) food programs in schools for low income housing areas; 5) subsidies for transit for low income persons and families; 6)  anti-racist training, and non-violent conflict resolution training for police, using the mental health team more effectively; 7) more recreational programs that are accessible for children and youth from low income areas."
"Lack of decent paying jobs, exploiting employers and expensiveness of everything"
"Lack of education, lack of coordination of services, lack of affordable housing, punitive welfare system."
"lack of education,lack of jobs,taxes"
lack of employement opportunities and a minimum wage that keeps people below the poverty line. 
Lack of employment opportunities is one driving force.  Effects include people not able to obtain nutritious food or pay for adequate housing.
"Lack of employment opportunities, affordable rent, and help for people with mental illness. Seniors without work pension have a hard time getting by, especially if single. People who grow up poor have a hard time escaping that beginning."
Lack of employment opportunities; lack of support to single mothers and their children; high rents in low-income areas; not enough subsidized housing
"Lack of employment, affordable training opportunities and access to education. Inadequate access to the necessities of life such as food, clothing, shelter, daycare and transportation. It also impact individual's mental health due to the stresses associated with just trying to survive. "
"Lack of employment.  If immigrants and refugees could get work and support their families along with appropriate health care and other support to get them established, there would be less poverty."
"Lack of equal opportunity, lack of proper community housing, minorities being ignored, not enough attention to the children and young adults"
Lack of funds/ public services 
Lack of good - paying jobs and unaffordable housing .
"Lack of good jobs that pay a decent enough wage. I graduated with friends who are stuck in contract jobs, minimum wage jobs or volunteer internships. They are skilled and well trained people but cannot find permanent jobs. I STRONGLY disagree that people without jobs need training. Only politicians and think tanks disconnected from reality say things like this. My friends are just like me, but I am lucky I have a good paying, unionized job. I can afford childcare and as a mom, this helps me get to work and contribute financially to my family. My friends who are stuck in poverty are either raising a child in poverty, which further marginalizes them, or are continually putting off having a family."
"Lack of good, full-time jobs; inadequate income supports (OW, ODSP, Child benefits); unfair taxation (e.g. regressive property tax); lack of access to affordable services (housing, child care, recreation); unequal education system (fewer programs and resources at schools in poor areas); domination of politics by powerful groups (e.g. business)"
lack of job opportunties for those with disability 
"Lack of manufacturing jobs.  Single parent families.  High cost of living in Toronto.  Mental health issues; physical and dental health issues; loss of self-esteem; loss of hope, without which it is impossible to dream a future for one's self; poor school performance for children and loss of their full potential"
Lack of opportunity for people to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps.
Lack of opportunity; lack of education; sometimes mental health; breakdown of family support; alienation; isolation; stigma; 
lack of opportunties leads to social isolation making it hard to connect with others and community. lack of affordable housing and job opportunties means staying in poverty longer making it harder to improve your social and economic conditions. 
"Lack of regulation on the rich. The perception among the rich that their economic well-being is purely intertwined with their own merit, while the poverty of the poor is their own fault. Continual pressure to reduce taxes at the expense of programs that help the least-privileged. "
"Lack of stable and affordable housing options, issues obtaining housing due to discrimination related to factors such as race and gender, social background, socioeconomic status (e.g. discrimination against anyone on social assistance), insufficient social assistance to help keep everyone above the ground (whether its through concrete programs such as OW, ODSP; or community programs or support workers that simply support those living in poverty by providing guidance and encouraging stability)  Effects? Everything! The type of work, the amount of work hours someone has... This affects home life. Depending on the neighbourhood someone lives in, they may have to opt for living in a place that has limited transit options. The lack of stability in a person's life can prevent them from moving upwards in work. Food security becomes an issue. Health becomes an issue, when considering the social determinants of health. Chronic stress. All of these factors affect someone's quality of life, and does not allow a person to thrive."
"Lack of suitable employment opportunities, limited transportation and a lack of affordable housing. Education not geared to the needs of children who are at risk. Federal and provincial downloading of services.  Effects: despair, anger, violence, graffiti, alienation, hopelessness, crime              limited economic growth, urban blight              greater need for food banks, the need for Out of the Cold programs, demand for more policing, tough on crime agenda     "
"Lack of synchronized support systems - there are a myraid of agencies and people working but there is no concerted effort to share and help together - it is almost as if it is a numbers game for funding purposes.  Accountability of parents and schools and early monitoring would definitely help reduce child poverty. Providing more assistance to people who actually need it, through sharing data between agencies would be a good place to start, and not just working with pre-conceived notions. Creating more programs to integrate the newcomers and refugees on how to live and behave in a city here.  Effects: Crime, ill-health, no pride in being a denizen of this great city, victimization."
lack of well paying jobs 
"Less job opportunities. Politian's   thinking process should change.  Low health, no money for children to go to school."

"Loss of lack of employment, underemployment, high housing and living cost "
"Low income, high rents"
Low minimum wage  Large wage gap  Housing costs 
"Low wage economy, not enought jobs"
"Low wage work - one puts in the same hours and level of workload as someone you know who also works honestly, but is paid much more and while your work is temporary, his/hers is permanent and full time.  Depressing, angering.    It's the economy and unfairness of it.  And then there are the street people who don't even have work, or food, or a place to live."
Low wages and high cost of living ( food and rent). Many people have to choose between saving towards a goal (ex. Buying A car) and putting a roof over their heads  Poor sex-ed knowledge taught in high school. Many people are having  kids they can't afford to take care of because they don't know what birth control is/how to get it.   Illness. For ex. Many people can't afford to buy prescriptions put of pocket and end up having to take time off work and less pay. 
"Low wages, few good jobs available, cuts to government spending on housing and services, and the reliance of the economy on private investment decisions for the operation of the economy. It destroys the lives of children, many women, working people who live with it, and in particular, people of colour and immigrants."
"Low wages, high rental, transportation cost and high food costs. The policies that are in place do not allow up to get out of the hole. If you are on OW you have Medical services paid for. if you get a low paying job, that is suddenly gone and you are worse off then if you were on OW. There are few opportunities to allow you to get out of that hole. Women lie to say that they are separated although the partner is still involved and children see this and learn to embellish the truth. I see that with the clients that I serve and I know the system will penalize he whole family if they told the truth"
"low wages, low social assistance rates, high un(der)employment, lack of access to education and training"
"Low wages, unemployment, lack of social services, racism, lack of community spirit, rugged individualism contribute to poverty.  Over time poverty leads to the criminalization of the poor, who are over represented in prisons.  It also leads to poorer health, lack of dental and vision care."
"Many of the supports are there, but there is poor coordination among service providers. People living in poverty may not be aware of all the services available or may not be aware of how to access those services. "
"Many temporary workers, many apprentices, they live no space to the skilled workers."
"mental illness, the economy, Toronto is a magnet for immigrants and refugees, diversity of our cultures is a drawing card for Toronto for newcomers. "

My answers come in the previous questions.
"My experience is in assisting low income immigrant and racial minority women, and women in serious life transitions  to acquire marketable skills for jobs in demand, particularly for higher paid jobs such as in IT and Trades. I have come to understand   child poverty within the context of adult poverty, and in particular, women's vulnerability to poverty -  women are 50% of the labour force. You don't have poor children without poor women. A poverty strategy needs to be tackled from many dimensions, prevention, mitigation, children, adults, vulnerable populations. Labour force development strategies and investment in development of human capital need to form a big part of any poverty reduction plan. We need greater investment in nimble labour force development strategies that keep the skills of our adult population current with skills in demand in growth occupations and growth sectors. We need to incorporate a gender lens and gender framework into any labour force development strategies for both young and adult women.  We need a concerted effort to engaging young and adult women in STEM careers- We need to tackle both prevention and mitigation at the same time, to address the cycle of poverty; children need role models; our adult clients tell us that their children are inspired by their mother's accomplishments when the retrain for a more viable careers in non-traditional occupations/sectors. We need serious commitment from government, education, training, labour and business to redress the gender imbalance in trades and STEM careers for both young and adult women with equity targets  within meaningful timelines  While both are important to reduce poverty, we should aim to achieve a dynamic that sees greater investment in human development, while strengthening the social safety net    "
"Nepotism, institutionalised discrimination in the workplace, childcare that is too expensive"
"new comers with low paid jobs, unemployment for youth coming out of universities & colleges. "
"No one wants to hire you without experience, no one wants to give you the experience without the education, people can barely afford to pay for their education so they become stuck. People who are stuck, become frustrated and then become angry. A society full of angry and frustrated people can only lead to crime, violence, hatred, etc. Eventually the mentalities of people change and it becomes a ""by any means necessary"" turnout. "
"No rent control, therefore landlords keep raising the rent."
"Non-livable minimum wages and unaffordable housing is driving poverty in Toronto  Poor health, obesity, diabetes, and mental challenges are all effects of poverty"
Not enough affordable housing.  Not enough affordable public transportation to all parts of the city.  
Not enough housing and low minimum wages.  Expensive daycare and housing.
Not enough jobs and low wages
"not enough jobs with good pay, lack of affordable housing"
Not having a liveable minimum wage!! 
"Obviously there are many factors driving poverty and it is a complex issue. However, I do think that part of the reason is that the state continues to cut the taxes of those in the highest income bracket, leaving the programs that help marginalized communities at risk. Cutting funding for homeless shelters, for example, is heartless. As a child, the City of Toronto provided free swimming lessons at Flemingdon Park. The government should continue to do such programs--kids shouldn't be left skill-less due to their economic situation. "
"One of the biggest things driving poverty is the intergenerational cycle of poverty for those who have lived in the city for generations. Many of these families are exposed to a number of sociodemographic risk (e.g. mental health, low education attainment, lack of resources, addictions, domestic violence, homelessness, etc.) in which they do not receive adequate support in managing. These sociodemographic risks affects how parents interact with their children which in turn places their children at risk for poorer outcomes in multiple domains such as education, socioemotional adjustment, cognitive functioning. To address poverty, more coordinated efforts that involve partnerships across sectors (e.g., public health, health, mental health, education, child welfare) are needed so that intervention strategies are streamlined.  For immigrant families, similar effects of sociodemographic risk affect family functioning, although how these risks are manifested within families may be different. "
"Our church practices radical hospitality and poor people eat , sleep and are generally present at church, but only if staff or volunteers are there. Many of the poor are mentally ill or estranged from their families or immigrants that find it difficult to integrate into the working world."
"Our government has seen to it that the rich stay rich and get richer. the poor, elderly and disabled, are disposable. Look around the city. It's criminal to see the despair and destitute in our country, full of people barely living, hand to mouth, when our leaders live like Kings and give billions of dollars to other countries and cut basic needs and services here at home."
"People get into poverty for many reasons - disability, job discrimination, lack of educational opportunity, lack of family support, substance dependency - but poverty is fundamentally a lack of income. OW and ODSP rates, and even minimum wage, do not provide enough income to live with dignity, especially in a city like Toronto with high housing costs. Poverty compromises physical and mental health and fosters cycles of hopelessness and dependency. Poverty denies people the opportunities they need to get out of poverty."
Policy that does not take into account the complicated and specific ways that poverty effects people and what their main barriers are. I think poverty persists because of a general misunderstanding of what poverty looks like and why it effects people. Poverty also persists because there is not a lot of room given to people to speak about what it actually means to live in poverty. 
poor job market
"Poor thought out policies/legistration from a municipal, provincial and federal.  Discrimination"
"Poverty has no one push it is an accumualtion of attitude, educational opportunities and available resources as well as support.  I personally found when I was in need of assistance to rebuild my life I was only offerred more drop ins and art programs, I was not encouraged to attend city functions and community events or education ( when I enquired about school I was told it any class or program didn't lead to a job at the outset it would not be covered)"
"Poverty is a direct result of the marginalising effects of our business model world. All our lives have hiccups, but when employers are encouraged by economic forces to terminate struggling employees in favour of hiring new employees who can manage an ""expected"" workload people who through mental health, addiction, newcomer status,  or new motherhood can't satisfy those  ""expected"" requirements those hiccups mainline a person into poverty."
"Poverty is a result of our rigged rules that allow corporations and financial institutions to skim the top off of our recovery and leave nothing to employees and consumers. Instead of creating more jobs and a stronger economy our practices of deregulation, privatization, and austerity are leaving more and more families fending for themselves with no way to get on their feet. Too many people have bought into the myth that anyone can make it if they work hard enough. That is false. If you are single parent with a disability, and you couldn't afford to go to university, there is almost no opportunity for you to live beyond subsistence. And this is not to mention the unconscious biases that prevent us from giving others a fair chance, our unintentional racism, sexism, and ablism, make it even harder for the least advantages among us to have a shot.  Living in poverty is disempowering. You plan less for the future because you know for a fact how little control you have over what happens in your life. "
"Poverty is caused by inadequate income - from precarious and low-paying jobs, and inadequate income security programs (eg OW, ODSP). Discrimination and inequities in the labour market cause some groups (women-led households, immigrants & refugees, racialized groups, people with disabilities) to face higher levels of poverty, regardless of education and credentials.   Poverty is associated with stress, social exclusion, and physical and mental health effects. Factors related to poverty - food insecurity, inadequate housing, living in neighbourhoods with diminished access to services and transit, barriers to post-secondary education - create barriers that lead to an intergenerational cycle of poverty.   Inequality affects the health of a whole society - those at the top and the bottom. The widening gap between individuals, groups and neighbourhoods undermines unity and prosperity. "
"Poverty is cyclical and more pervasive in some of Toronto's communities.  The effects are the creation of unsafe communities, poor physical, emotional, and mental health outcomes, a loss of hope and social isolation."
"Poverty is driv en by multiple factors, low employment, expensive housing, Transit and the overall tax system in Canada."
"Poverty is driven by a lack of access to resources. The biggest driving forces of poverty are a minimum wage that is not sufficient to live off of, unaffordable and difficult to access childcare, and the current Ontario Works system. In regards to Ontario Works, it is set up in a way that a person must lose all of their assets before being able to qualify, and then it pays so little that it would be incredibly difficult to get out of poverty.   Poverty affects all areas of life. Individuals living in poverty are less healthy and have a higher rate of disease. They have higher rates of mental illness. Children living in poverty do not have access to proper nutrition, so their brains and bodies cannot develop to their fullest potential.   Working in social services, I see the direct effect that poverty has on children and families. "
Poverty is driven by low wages including a low minimum wage and by a lack of employment opportunities especially for young adults.
"Poverty is driven by wealth, by people refusing to pay taxes which is how we look after each other. Poverty is driven by the drive to build condos which buys up land at exhorbitant prices which drive up the price of other lands. Poverty is driven by racism, genderism and a prejudice against single mothers. Poverty is driven by holes in the safety net for older people. We fall through and get lost. I WOULD LOVE TO BE INVOLVED IN A TRULY PRODUCTIVE EFFORT TO END THIS not a Band-Aid effort to make the city look better than it deserves."
"Precarious employment Corporate culture that, as is legally dictated, values profit more than anything else.  Legislation has to change in order to redirect efforts to create sustainable, well-paid positions.  Lack of meaningful opportunity for highly qualified newcomers/immigrants.  Inequity Social capital/networks/status are really what get people jobs.  Experience and intelligence are a bonus.  For those who don't already have access to social capital, they have to work far harder to get noticed, build inroads, find stable jobs that pay a living wage.  Many people don't understand how to navigate this world and therefore get frustrated and take lower paying jobs or give up.  Broken social welfare system.  Antiquated infrastructure, including housing.   Antiquated education curriculum and teaching practices that are Euro-centric, patriarchal, and reflect the values of the industrial age--doesn't reflect the diversity of this city or the current labour market.  Lack of recognition of key skills to acquire employment from both employers and potential employees.  A narrow vision of hiring.  Systemic racism and discrimination.   Bad law enforcement policy.  Bad economic policy that favours corporations over humans.  A lack of programs to reduce recidivism.   Effects: Increasing inequity and growing divide between wealthy and poor.  A shrinking middle class.  The wealthy continue to increase wealth based on social capital. Inaccessible job markets. Lack of affordable housing. Increased crime and sometimes violence which is concentrated in certain communities and neighbourhoods because of poverty and marginalization.  Anger, frustration, a sense of being failed by government, institutions... Lack of empathy and compassion between people of different backgrounds, social demographics.  Misunderstandings perpetuated by media.  The poor falling further and further behind."
"Precarious employment is creating a situation in which even people working in full-time, full year positions are living in poverty. Additionally, social assistance rates are low and associated services are insufficient (e.g. housing benefits) or poorly targeted (e.g. lack of publicly-provided health benefits for people with low income)."
"preoccupation with self and one's own family/friends; feelings of being overwhelmed and ""what can I do""; easier to bring a food bank item, write a cheque than to involve oneself with making change at the systemic level;  Effects:  increased health care costs,unemployment, homelessness, feelings of them vs us, anger, a city compartmentalized; "
Primarily the high cost of living (especially housing costs) as compared to average salaries / retirement incomes.

"Question 1: The ongoing austierity strategy of low taxes for the rich and corporations, low interest rates, socialization of debt recovery and risk for corporations (this is not free market capitalism at all - this has re-routed citizen's money directly to private corporations and away from the very programs that are our social welfare net- the programs that promote social equalization ie, a thriving middle class), deregulation of markets, privatization of public serivces, cutting of public services and the social safety net and the reduction of all services to some silly formula about how much they cost when the value of the service is what they provide to society- health, people's well-being, a thriving middle class, cohesion, and yes, even happiness- social development is not an easy thing to measure, but there are so many studies that work on social indicators that have shown when you fund programs and services that address root causes and prevention that support people in poverty and a range of other risk-based situations, they thrive and cohesion is developed. Doing more surveys seems a bit silly given the knowledge is out there. It is time to put resources into what we know works and start changing the political and policy environment because that is what is driving poverty here in Toronto and beyond. Yes, I am a Sociologist.   Question 2: I think the effects of poverty are multi-fold and range from individual effects to community, to social. On an individual level each person is impacted differently, but we know we see things ranging from mental health issues, health issues, addiction, behavioural, delays of various types, higher incidents with the law and other institutional systems; there can be difficulty meeting basic needs; benign neglect; negative coping behaviours; lack of access to things that others can easily access with money like education and potentially higher paying jobs; cycles of inter generational poverty;. On a community level, entire communities may be traumatized, gangs may be a reality, lack of community resources, proper housing and supports, lack of services and supports, they may face discriminatory treatment from those providing services - these negative experiences may compound the individual level traumas and challenges they experience, placing them at even greater risk.

Rising inequality.  The effects have been well documented.   
"Scarcity mindset drives poverty. The idea that there is not enough for everyone promotes a poverty-ridden existence. Fear creates poverty. Lack of trust creates poverty. Hatred and anger create poverty. The effects of poverty are a society overwhelmed with fear, mistrust, hatred, and anger. The effect of poverty is violent conflict or war."

"Stigma is driving poverty in Toronto. Also, Toronto is trying to move all the homeless off the streets so they look ""prettier"" for tourists, meanwhile not caring at all for the lives of the people they're pushing away.

"Structural violence, racism, unfair tax structures, 'gentrification', property prices, sexism, inadequate mental health treatment facilities, minimum wage too low, inadequate care for single parents (no free day care, etc.)"
"Systemic classism, racism, transphobia and misogyny drives poverty in Toronto. You have a minority of people who are in power and who do things such as decrease taxation of corporations/businesses, build more condos when people can barely find housing etc. in order to benefit themselves instead of listening to the people living in their cities.  The effects of poverty are many: - Poor physical health - Poor mental health - Homelessness - Unemployment or working precarious jobs - Being food insecure - Less access to education - Less access to day care for low income/single parents - Police brutality and harassment - Social isolation - Death (how many homeless people die per year in Toronto and no one talks about it) - Increased risk of being subject to violence - Less access to health care (being able to purchase proper medication for example)"
"Systemic inequity. The systems we have in place in Canada and Toronto, education, social services, employment, etc., continue to marginalize and harm those most vulnerable. We are constantly reverting to individualistic ways of thinking... at the end of the day ""its that persons fault they are homeless; if they wanted a job, they could get one, etc."" This type of misinformed underlying thinking, accompanied by systemic inequity, is really contributing to the perpetuation of poverty in our city."

High tuition fees, a lack of funding for masters level students and unpaid internships have contributed to my financial insecurity. This sense of insecurity led to a strain on relationships and poorer mental and physical health. "
"The causes are complex and include the relocation of business to developing and free trade regions, tax changes that reduce redistributive opportunities for government, obstacles that prevent newcomers from working at their potential, and the increase in precarious employment. Here in Toronto, one of the biggest factors is the high cost of housing and the shortage of rental housing.  The short term effects of poverty are bad enough--people going hungry, going without medical care or prescriptions that aren't covered, losing their homes because they can't pay the rent. The longer term effects are less well known--worse health, shorter longevity, and increased social, emotional and mental health problems. Ultimately, poverty has an impact on all of us through lost productivity and reduced consumption."
The causes of poverty are complex.  Lack of communication + fear + a loss of volunteerism + rampant consumerism are major contributing factors.
"The downward spiral of fairly paid jobs offered by companies. Offering no full-time positions/benefits. Limited or no pay raises.  Undercutting of established systems that put in jeopardy the work of others (John Tory gave open, public permission for Uber taxi to exist without questioning). Harris Government stripped down labour laws, Federal Gov. cut off at the knees the unions' ability to negotiate. Overuse of foreign labour....even the profitable banks draw in skilled contract workers instead of hiring Canadian educated  Poor, quality (therefore, poor quality life) housing....no decent, system with teeth that deals with slum lords who never have inspections or have to (by court order) follow through with improvements. They are everywhere. Limited low income housing starts (Ontario Housing disappeared..again another Prov/Fed. dynamic. We absorb much of the countries immigration....with not enough housing...increasing the housing pressure and no competition in the housing market"
"The drive for multiculturalism is backfiring... People want to hire people who can speak the language of those immigrating to Canada... so they are hiring immigrants. So if I am native to Canada and speak only English, I am being overlooked. Yet in Toronto, the face of customer service always has a foreign accent."
The fact that the basic human needs are commodities and not rights.
the Government
The high cost of living - high rent that takes away from people's household income.  High cost of good-quality food at the grocery store. 
The high housing prices combined with low salaries. The lack of a good transportation system makes housing unaffordable near subway lines. Car ins and maintenance is extremely expensive.
"The income gap is a huge part.  An unlivable minimum wage is also big, not to mention precarious employment.  My experiences are indirect - working with folks on disability benefits.  people I considered role models, people with schizophrenia who got up every day and walked to a volunteer job so as to feel part of the community and to help others."
"The increasing lack of a safety net, the decline in income for the middle and lower classes, the absense of a broad-based social housing program."
"The loss of manufacturing jobs; the growing inequality in the West; the indifference of many people.  The effects of poverty: loss of self-esteem, poor nutrition; sense of hopelessness."
"The real estate market and gentrification of previously affordable neighbourhoods, a lack of affordable rental accommodation, a high proportion of recent immigrants, underemployment. The effects are the creation of 1 or more ""underclasses"", sometimes becoming entrenched over generations."
"There are many drivers of poverty, from poor social supports, inadequate educational/language/retraining opportunities, mental health, increasing housing prices, decreased availability of affordable housing, low minimum wage.  The effects of poverty (which are also closely related to its causes) include poorer health and well-being, homelessness, crime, loss of potential. "
"there are many reasons for poverty:  lack of affordable housing, lack of well paid jobs,  low social assistance rates, growing up in poverty and lacking opportunities for a good education,  being disabled and unable to work, the list goes on and on"
There is no regard in Toronto for how high rents can be and the housing prices seem to have no limits. IT's becoming unaffordable to live in the city.
"there isnt enough jobs for the amount of people, more jobs that require little experience.  people have less food, more arguing, unhappy families resulting in unhappy homes "
"There's no single driver of poverty. So unless there is a comprehensive strategy that looks at everything from housing to education, from access to transit to at risk neighbourhoods, we can only patch a bandaid on a problem. "
"they cant access affordable housing and food. they don't have financial assistance. not enough money, lack of jobs. cant afford good clothing. "
"This is a very complex question. A lot of factors drive poverty in Toronto, specifically the number of newcomers to Canada with little income and qualifications that don't mean much in Canada, the high cost of living in the city including food, rent, and transit, as well as little opportunity for employment that has better opportunities to move up in the future. Many families I work with can find low paying, part time jobs but that is not realistic for a single mother of 3 to maintain and provide for her children. Toronto needs to do more to help not only find employment, but to create opportunities for full time, higher paying positions.   The effects of poverty are huge. There are children who are struggling and can't focus at school because they have not had breakfast or even dinner, but are too embarassed to say so. There are parents who start feeling depressed and overwhelmed because they cannot provide for their children's basic needs; this further impacts their ability to parent and be emotionally supportive to their kids because they are so drained or are working three jobs. Schools call children's aid on parents accusing when kids can't make it to school on a daily basis, or cannot get them a lunch everyday when really they just can't afford to do it and are doing their best. It is cyclical and never ending for some families and the effects of poverty can live on for generations. "
Too many immigrants. Too many people. Poor areas
"too many social assistance programs that pump money into people's pockets, many of which get accustomed to it and do not want to move forard witht heir lives, rather take the easy approach and collect money from the governments. OR those who are given false hopes of not having to work hard to achieve int heir lives. Having gone to workshops and seminars and so forth put forth by the city, I find that the message conveyed to people looking for ""hope"" and advise and assistance, is overly optimistic, it raised unrealistic initial expectations in individuals, and when they see the reality of the world we live in today, they are left feeling embarassed, mislead, disilusioned and in severe cases depressed. Today, it is much more important to work harder than ever before because the competition is fierce."
"Toronto cannot absorb the amount of people into its current amount of affordable housing.  There are not enough decent  places to live and thrive. In order to be successful, however new assisted communities must be planted, developed and nurtured with 'pride of ownership' that is shared by all.  Simply put, if a new community is created and then is left to rot after several years  and drugs and crime and gangs move in, then no one in the community wins.  It is a failure.  Guidelines, restrictions and laws  must be created to offer the greatest sense of safety, protection and pride of community.  Peer pressure I have noticed in my  client groups is a wonderful thing.

"Toronto is increasingly growing into a neoliberal city through continually cutting government funding to public services. Also, I think that crime is an effect of poverty. The way crime is framed and its relationship with issue of race and class are also important factors to take into consideration."
"Toronto is one of the most expensive cities in North America.   Our current housing stock can not support the needs of our population - affordable housing is underfunded and in high demand.  Our current Ontario Works benefit is does not provide enough for a single person to rent in this city, the income earning rules are so punitive that they do not encourage employment, and the health benefits are so poor (especially dental) that we often see increased health problems among our most vulnerable residents. These systems reinforce a cycle of poverty and reliance on the system for survival. "
"Unaffordable housing is a major factor pushing and keeping people in poverty. Lack of investment in building new social housing and repairing the housing we need keeps people living in poverty sick and diminishes morale. Underfunded transit system that makes it hard for people to get to work, do groceries, and access affordable food exacerbates the issue. Irrationally low social assistance rates, including ODSP and OW, as well as clawback of child benefits means people are living month to month and limits their ability to hope and organize for a better future. Emphasis on food banking as a solution to hunger means vulnerable people eat low quality food that worsens chronic health issues and saps energy. Unaffordable childcare means people stop working rather than spending thousands every month on daycare and limits women's opportunities to contribute economically in their households. Institutional racism and bureaucracy makes finding employment an insurmountable task for many newcomers. Lack of living wage in most workplaces means those who find work struggle as part of the living poor, and youth turn to opportunities to make quick money in dangerous situations rather than seeking employment.

unemployment
Unemployment and underemployment. Cost of housing. Low minimum wage. 
"uneven development, not enough investment in services to inner suburbs, concentrated investment downtown"
Unlivable wages.   Lack of manufacturing jobs. Mental illness Abuse Unjust distribution of wealth - rising gap between rich and everyone else
"unreached potential on all measures, more youth crime, more unemployment, more adult problems."
"Unstable jobs, not enough full-time, low wages, low social assistance rates, lack of wide access to EI.   Poverty causes stress and anxiety, over time can make it very hard for people to imagine living with more security.  Can make people feel like they are on the outside looking in at those that are more comfortable financially."
"We are a city of immigrants and do not have enough supports for them to receive gainful employment & incentives to hire them. We have an inherent bias against employing new immigrants due to various barriers including racism & discrimination, problems accepting new immigrant credentials from countries of origin, language barriers, physical barriers such as access to affordable transportation, appropriate clothing, lack of confidence and self esteem issues in interviews, lack of familiarity with Canadian life, businesses and opportunities. I have learned a lot about this because I am working as a full-time volunteer in Thorncliffe & Flemingdon Park with the Valley Park Go Green Cricket Field Project & am also involved in youth leadership and programming. I do believe that media bias and Islamaphobia also make it difficult for Newcomers to feel completely at ease within the Canadian system. They are appreciative of being here but have fears about trusting those in authority including the school, police etc. Different family values may also increase isolation."
"We are a transitioning economy, from indsutrail/manuafcturing to information/knowledge. These economies need far fewer people. The lack of good paying jobs is whats driving poverty, coupled the challenges of intergrating newcomers. The effects are high familiy stress and more children in care of CAS from these affected commu ities.  "
Wealthy business interests really run this city and their priority is not the circumstances of those less fortunate.
"Well, of course, the insane real estate market, driving up rents for those (the majority) Torontonians who are not homeowners, in tandem with pathetically insulting low minimum wage.  Yes, there's a drive to make it $14 or $15, but we all know this is not enough, don't we?  And for those of us who actually have jobs, 'tis the precariousness of them that tips us into poverty, the numbers of us growing daily and no doubt expontentially, i would venture.  And I'd say transportation again, being able to afford it.  Lastly, for those of still lucky enough to be able to keep homelessness at bay, the outrageous cost of hydro.  Effects:  Homelessness, Invisibility. Stigma and alienation; Illness, both physical and mental; increased polarization between the have/have nots; the ""criminalization"" of the poor-- speaking of which, increase in substance abuse ergo crime; increased hunger, adults not able to function properly whether it be to perform their work or parenting responsibilities, and in turn the impovershed children not being able to learn properly virtually ensuring underachievement.  Geez, i'll stop here, could write wayyyyy more...."

Who wrote this survey? Do you want actionable ideas? I bet you get less than a hundred people filling out this form. This type of open ended question- with three different parts to it- will get you useless information.   Ok I'll try: one of the drivers of poverty is a city that doesn't know how to prioritize action or talk to its citizens.
