Suicide is a critical concern. A recent study found that a quarter of Ontario student problems with gambling problems reported a suicide attempt in the past year – roughly 18 times higher than in the general student population (Cook et al., 2010).

Strongly in Favour,A new casino will sustain existing jobs at Woodbine and generate new jobs in a priority neighbourhood of the City
Somewhat Opposed,Thinking of the type of people that will 'hang around' the area
Strongly Opposed,"Cuturally, Toronto is a city believing in that you work hard to live a good life. A Casino sends the wrong message that you need to get lucky to live a good life. It's ok to have casinos in tourist cities like Niagara Falls, afterall you feel like getting lucky during a vacation, and then back to the reality of working hard back home. It's another thing to bring it to our day to day living and working area. It's the wrong thing to do!"

The casinos marketers know that it is this population that has a 40 + years of savings to draw from, property, and a guaranteed monthly cash flow (OAS at least)!  They are agressively courted and are the participants with the slot machines, when you look closely.  Free bus trips on Wednesdays are not offered to teenagers or college kids - instead older persons.   It could be your own parent next year who succumbs to the offers of casino markets.
